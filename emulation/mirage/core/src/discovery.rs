//! Shared discovery logic for locating emulator runtime libraries.
//!
//! mirage does not bundle or build its emulator backends. Instead it
//! expects the user to install them and then *finds* the relevant
//! shared library at runtime. This module implements the common search
//! policy so every backend looks in the same set of well-known
//! locations.
//!
//! An explicit override always wins first: any env var in
//! [`LibSearch::file_env`] holding an absolute path to the `.so`, then
//! any env var in [`LibSearch::dir_env`] holding a directory that
//! contains it, then any env var in [`LibSearch::home_env`] holding an
//! install root (with the library under `<root>/lib`).
//!
//! Absent an override, the backend-specific
//! [`LibSearch::binary_relative_dirs`] (resolved relative to the
//! `mirage` binary) are always searched — this lets an in-tree
//! `cargo build` of the monorepo find a freshly-built emulator without
//! any extra configuration.
//!
//! Backends that opt in via [`LibSearch::system_fallbacks`] also search
//! a set of generic locations (first match wins), as implemented by
//! `LibSearch::search_dirs`:
//!
//! 1. Every directory on `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
//! 2. `$ROCM_HOME` / `$ROCM_PATH` — the ROCm install root
//!    (`<root>/lib`).
//! 3. The ROCm SDK install root reported by `rocm-sdk path --root`
//!    (`<root>/lib`) — present when a ROCm Python wheel venv is
//!    active.
//! 4. `../lib` relative to the `mirage` binary.
//! 5. Standard system / ROCm library directories: `/opt/rocm/lib`,
//!    `/usr/local/lib`, `/usr/lib`, `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`.
//!
//! Every one of those locations is a fact about the machine mirage is
//! running on, and the only question a user has when a backend reports
//! itself uninstalled is which of them mirage looked at.
//! [`locate_emulator_lib`] therefore returns a [`RuntimeLocation`] — the
//! resolved library, or the list of paths that were probed and the
//! environment variables that would change the answer — and the plain
//! `Option` form ([`find_emulator_lib`]) is a thin wrapper over it, so
//! the search order is defined exactly once.
