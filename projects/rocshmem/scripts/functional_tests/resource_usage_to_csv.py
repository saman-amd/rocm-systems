"""Parse a resource_usage_summary.log (produced by a build compiled with
-Rpass-analysis=kernel-resource-usage) into a normalized CSV, one row per kernel.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/functional_tests/resource_usage_to_csv.py \\
        --log build/resource_usage_summary.log \\
        --arch gfx950 --build-config ipc_single \\
        --out resource_usage.csv

Rows are written to --out. If --out already exists, its rows are loaded and
updated: re-running with the same (arch, build-config, source_file, line,
mangled_name) tuple replaces the existing row instead of duplicating it, so
re-generating a build's numbers is idempotent.

    The log is a straight concatenation of `-Rpass-analysis=kernel-resource-usage`

    runs with `-j` > 1 (the normal case), multiple compiler processes emit their
    own multi-line remark blocks to the same shared log concurrently -- each
    individual line is written atomically, but there is no guarantee that one
    kernel's ~9-line block stays contiguous, so two (or more) kernels' blocks can
    interleave line-by-line. Every line in a remark block (not just the "Function
    Name" line) repeats that block's own "<file>:<line>:<col>:" location prefix,
    so a kernel's lines can always be routed back to it by that prefix alone --
    tracking one open row keyed by that location (instead of a single global
    "current row" that blindly accepts whatever line comes next) makes parsing
    immune to interleaving: a metric line can only ever update the row that was
