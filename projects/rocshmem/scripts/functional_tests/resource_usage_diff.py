"""Diff two resource-usage CSVs (see resource_usage_to_csv.py) produced from
two different commits/builds, matched on (arch, build_config, mangled_name).

Matching by mangled_name (not source_file:line) so a function that moved
lines between commits is still compared correctly; template instantiations
keep distinct mangled names so they stay distinct rows.

Occupancy [waves/SIMD] is not an independent resource: it is the compiler's
resident-wavefront count per SIMD, capped by whichever of the VGPR file, the
SGPR file, or the LDS budget is tightest for that specific kernel. It can
move in a different direction than any single resource column — e.g. VGPRs
can go up while occupancy also goes up, if the same change relieves LDS or
SGPR pressure instead. For that reason this script colors the occupancy
panel by its own delta (more waves/SIMD = better) independently of how the
VGPR/SGPR/scratch/LDS panels are colored (less usage = better).

Usage:
    python3 scripts/functional_tests/resource_usage_diff.py \\
        --baseline resource_usage_commitA.csv \\
        --branch   resource_usage_commitB.csv \\
        --out      resource_usage_diff.csv \\
        --chart    resource_usage_diff.png \\
        --sort-by VGPRs

Use --match <regex> to pin specific kernels (matched against demangled_name or
mangled_name, case-insensitive) at the top of the text report and chart, even
if their delta is zero for every column -- useful when tracking one or two
kernels you care about instead of whatever happens to have the largest delta.

DynamicStack ("True"/"False", whether the kernel needs a dynamically-sized
stack frame) is a boolean compiler remark, not a resource count, so it isn't
part of NUMERIC_COLS/--sort-by. A baseline<->branch flip is still surfaced
per kernel in the text report (and counted in the "kernels changed" summary)
since a kernel gaining a dynamic stack is a real codegen change worth noticing
even when register/spill counts don't move.
