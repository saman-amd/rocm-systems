// Bounded SPSC handoff of copied record batches, from the ring-copier to the
// record processor. The split is load-bearing: a single thread doing both the
// copy and the pairing fell behind and overran the firmware ring.
//
// The slots ARE the buffer pool: each holds a vector whose capacity is reused,
// so steady state allocates nothing.
//
// The producer NEVER blocks. With no free slot acquire() returns nullptr and the
// caller queues the batch in its own overflow: blocking would stall the ring
// read and cause the very overrun this split avoids.
//
// MEMORY ORDERING: the release/acquire pair on m_tail publishes the filled bytes
// to the consumer; the pair on m_head publishes the slot's availability, so the
// producer cannot overwrite a batch the consumer is still reading. Each index
// has exactly one writer, so neither is a read-modify-write.
