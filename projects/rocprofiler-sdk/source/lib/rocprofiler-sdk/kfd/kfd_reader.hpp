// KFD dispatch-log reader thread: a background thread owning the dispatch-log
// data ring. It sets up the KFD session, then poll()s one control eventfd plus
// every live stream fd (with a 10 ms timeout as the sparse-tail / lost-interrupt
// watchdog), drains firmware records, pairs dispatch_start + eop, and deposits
// paired timings into the ResultsMap. wptr != rptr is the sole drain authority;
// poll wakes are only hints. Finalization uses nudge_reader() +
// wait_for_reader_quiesce() so the poll timeout never delays teardown.
//
// Started lazily by the first establish_session() -- which is reached only from a
// kernel-dispatch-tracing context arming, or from an intercepted dispatch -- so a
// process with no consumer of kernel-dispatch data never creates it. Stopped from
// shutdown_kfd_profiler(). Both are idempotent and safe when the dispatch-log is
// unavailable.
