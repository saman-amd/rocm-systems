# Changelog for ROCprofiler-SDK

Full documentation for ROCprofiler-SDK is available at [rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-sdk](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-sdk/en/latest/index.html)

## Unreleased

### Added

**API:**

  - Advanced Thread Trace (ATT) support in the live attach workflow:
    - On attach, the SDK registers for code-object iteration and creation callbacks so thread trace operates correctly on code objects that were loaded before the attach occurred.
    - Makes ATT usable on already-running production workloads without an application restart.
  - Experimental SQTT quick scan mode for thread trace, enabled through a new CMake flag:
    - Collects thread trace data without packet insertion or HSA signal manipulation, removing the queue interception overhead required by the standard ATT path.
    - Individual kernels can be traced without serialization, and the path is independent of the ROCm runtime version.
    - Experimental: intended to validate the new collection path and to enable out-of-process thread trace and long-kernel tracing in future releases.

**rocprof-trace-decoder:**

  - Python API for decoding Advanced Thread Trace (ATT) / SQTT data directly from Python, without writing a C++ consumer:
    - Wraps the decoder library and exposes thread trace decoding as a first-class Python interface, with samples demonstrating common workflows.
    - Useful for analysis scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and custom profiling tools that process ATT output programmatically.
    - Decoder integration tests have been migrated to Python, simplifying test authoring and making it easier for downstream tools to validate their trace-decoding pipelines.

### Changed


### Resolved issues


### Removed

## ROCprofiler-SDK 1.3.5 for ROCm release 10.0.0

### Added

**API:**

  - rocSHMEM host-stream API interception for the rocSHMEM tracing domain introduced in 1.3.0:
    - `rocshmem_putmem_on_stream`, `rocshmem_getmem_on_stream`, and `rocshmem_alltoallmem_on_stream` are intercepted and emitted as per-call trace records.
    - Records are interleaved with HIP, HSA, RCCL, and other runtime traces so rocSHMEM communication activity can be viewed on the same timeline as GPU compute.
  - hipFile API tracing as a first-class tracing domain:
    - hipFile API calls are intercepted through dispatch-table wrapping and emitted as per-call trace records alongside HIP, HSA, and other runtime activity.
    - Enables file I/O operations to be correlated with GPU kernels and memory copies in a single profiling timeline.
  - Streaming Performance Monitor (SPM) counter data in the rocpd output format:
    - SPM records are stored as `rocpd_track` rows labelled `SPM`, with counter values grouped by timestamp into `rocpd_sample` rows and per-dimension data in `rocpd_pmc_event` rows.
    - The rocpd schema gains the `sample_id`, `xcc`, `shader_engine`, and `instance` columns.
    - SPM data is consumable by any tool that reads the rocpd database and is convertible to CSV via `rocpd convert`. Conversion to the other output formats, such as Perfetto and OTF2, is not yet supported.

**rocprofv3 (CLI):**

  - OpenMP (OMPT) tracing via the new `--ompt-trace` flag:
    - Accepts a bare boolean or a space-separated category list (`all` `thread` `parallel` `task` `sync` `mutex` `target` `device` `error`), following the same style as `--pmc` and `--output-format`; for example, `--ompt-trace parallel task target sync`. Categories must be space-separated; comma-separated tokens are rejected. Also folded into `--sys-trace`/`--runtime-trace`.
    - rocpd-only trace: records go to the rocpd database (the default output format) and are exported via `rocpd convert`.
    - The OMPT callback layer is already supported by ROCprofiler-SDK; this flag makes it accessible without writing a custom tool.
  - hipFile API tracing via the new `--hipfile-trace` flag (or the `ROCPROF_HIPFILE_API_TRACE` environment variable):
    - Automatically included in `--runtime-trace` and `--sys-trace`.
    - Records are emitted across all supported output backends: CSV, JSON, Perfetto, OTF2, and rocpd.
  - Container-aware `rocattach` symbol resolution: attach entry points are resolved directly from the target process mapped ELF, and tool paths are validated from the target's perspective before injection. This allows attaching from a host to a containerized process without manually copying `.so` files.

### Changed

- Previously, `rocattach` calculated symbol offsets from the host's `librocprofiler-register.so` and applied them to the target's mapping, which failed when the host and container libraries differ in ELF layout or path. Offsets are now resolved from the target process itself.
- Idle inline queues with no active profiling consumers now bypass queue interposition entirely, reducing overhead for applications that create queues but do not immediately dispatch work.
- DWARF information is now parsed lazily, reducing startup overhead for attach and tracing sessions on large binaries.
- Disabled autoflush in thread trace to prevent premature buffer flushes that produced incomplete or corrupted traces.
- Bump rocpd schema to version 3.0.1 which supports NIC agent types.
- Bump rocpd schema to version 3.0.2 for HIP graph per-node attribution (`graph_exec_id`/`graph_node_id` columns on `rocpd_kernel_dispatch`/`rocpd_memory_copy` and the new `rocpd_graph_launch` table). The pre-graph-attribution 3.0.1 schema is now frozen under `versions/3.0.1/` per the rocpd schema versioning scheme.
- Bump rocpd schema to version 3.0.3 for SPM support. The pre-spm-support 3.0.2 schema is now frozen under `versions/3.0.2/` per the rocpd schema versioning scheme.

### Resolved issues

- Fixed a GPU stall in device thread trace that occurred when thread trace was started before `hsa_init()`.
- Fixed a counter-collection stall caused by an `InterceptQueue` ordering bug, and fixed an out-of-bounds write in `Submit()`.
- Fixed `roctxMark` calls propagating as kernel rename labels, which caused spurious kernel name changes in traces containing ROCTx markers.
- Fixed SQ aliasing on harvested WGPs and multi-counter desync on gfx11xx targets in AQLprofile, and corrected the `GcEaSeCounterBlockMaxEvent` value.
- Added a guard to prevent double-initialization of the PC sampling service.
- Fixed `rocprofv3` attach sessions exiting before all buffered output was flushed; attach sessions now block until the flush completes.
- Fixed the ordering of code object callbacks during attach, which could race with tools that depend on ordered delivery.
- Fixed the `fmt/format.h` include path, the `fpic` flag for samples, OMP lookup in CI, and clang-tidy quickscan enablement.

### Known issues

- SPM sessions can remain in a stale state after abrupt termination. See [GitHub issue #6489](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/issues/6489) for details.

### Removed

- Dependency on `libatomic`. The library was previously linked unconditionally through the `rocprofiler-sdk-atomic` interface target, which caused link failures on toolchains and container images where `libatomic1` is not installed. The single `std::atomic` use that required it has been replaced with explicit memory-ordering synchronization; behavior is unchanged.


## ROCprofiler-SDK 1.3.2 for ROCm release 7.14

### Added

**API:**

- Streaming Performance Monitor (SPM) counter collection support (beta):
    - New experimental API in `rocprofiler-sdk/experimental/spm.h`:
    - GPU-timestamped counter values alongside kernel dispatch information.
  - Added `spm_support` along with reserved padding to `rocprofiler_counter_info_v1_t`
  - Anytime initialization support.
    - Tools can call `rocprofiler_force_configure` after one or more other tools have configured rocprofiler-sdk.
      - NOTE: during the initialization of another tool, there is a small window where previously existing tools will not receive records generated from application background threads.

**rocprofv3(CLI):**
  - SPM counter collection support in `rocprofv3` (beta):
    - `--spm <counter>` flag to specify counters for SPM collection.
    - `--spm-sample-interval` and `--spm-sample-interval-unit` parameters to configure sampling rate.
    - `--spm-beta-enabled` flag to opt in to the beta SPM feature.
    - `--spm-config` option in `rocprofv3-avail` to list available SPM configurations.
  - JSON output format support for SPM.

**Documentation:**

  - SPM API reference guide (`api-reference/spm.rst`).
  - SPM usage guide for `rocprofv3` (`how-to/using-spm.rst`).
  - `--spm-config` documentation to `rocprofv3-avail` usage guide.

## ROCprofiler-SDK 1.3.0 for ROCm release 7.2.4

### Optimized

- Reduced ROCprofiler-sdk profiling overhead: Improved profiling stability for vLLM workloads traced with PyTorch torch.profiler using the rocprofiler-sdk backend.

## ROCprofiler-SDK 1.3.0 for ROCm release 7.13

### Added

**API:**

- Late-start profiling support: Added automatic late‑start profiling support, enabling profiling when `rocprofiler-sdk` is loaded after HSA/HIP runtimes have already initialized.
  - `rocprofiler_force_configure()` now automatically detects and profiles runtimes initialized before the SDK loads.
  - Integrates with `rocprofiler-register` to retrieve the registered API tables.
  - Supports all runtime types (HSA, HIP, ROCTX, RCCL, ROCDecode, ROCJpeg, and more) automatically.
  - No explicit late-start API calls required; works transparently.

- KFD (Kernel Fusion Driver) event tracing support:
  - Buffer service configurations for each KFD buffer tracing type.
  - New type `tool_buffer_tracing_kfd_record_t` using `std::variant` to wrap 8 different KFD buffer tracing types.
  - Each KFD event generates `rocpd_info_pmc`, `rocpd_event`, `rocpd_region`, and `rocpd_pmc_event` rows
  - Fixed handling for special SVM location in KFD prefetch location reporting
  - Fixed parsing for queue restore events to handle both correct format (character '0') and broken driver format (NULL character '\0')

- Per-graph-node attribution for HIP graph operations:
  - New callback tracing kind `ROCPROFILER_CALLBACK_TRACING_HIP_GRAPH` fires for `hipGraphInstantiate*`, `hipGraphExecDestroy`, and `hipGraphLaunch{,_spt}` lifecycle events. Payload carries a process-monotonic `graph_exec_id` and the raw `hipGraphExec_t` handle. Mirrors the `HIP_STREAM` design.
  - New buffer tracing kind `ROCPROFILER_BUFFER_TRACING_HIP_GRAPH` emits a summary record per successful `hipGraphLaunch` invocation with `graph_exec_id`, `kernel_dispatch_count`, agent, and launch timestamps.
  - Tools can associate kernel dispatches and memory copies with their producing graph node by maintaining a per-thread attribution stack (push on EXEC_LAUNCH ENTER, pop on EXIT) and capturing the top of stack into the external correlation id at request time. See the doc comment on `rocprofiler_callback_tracing_hip_graph_data_t` for the recipe.
  - Attribution accuracy across launches requires segmented scheduling (default), `AMD_DIRECT_DISPATCH=1`, and single-threaded launching of one `hipGraphExec_t`.

**rocprofv3 (CLI):**

- Multi-pass counter collection support: Support for multiple `--pmc` flags to define separate counter groups for different profiling passes.
  - Ability to combine command-line `--pmc` flags with input file counter groups.
  - Each pass generates output in a separate `pass_n` subdirectory.
  - Example: `rocprofv3 --pmc SQ_WAVES --pmc GRBM_COUNT -- <app>` creates two profiling passes.

- KFD (Kernel Fusion Driver) event tracing support:
  - KFD record dumping to `rocpd` with support for 8 main KFD event types.
  - Support for `rocpd` to Perfetto conversion for KFD events.
  - `--kfd-trace` flag to enable KFD event tracing.

- ROCTx Support for ATT: Added ROCtx support to device thread trace when using `--att --selected-regions`.
  - Allows `roctxProfilerPause` and `roctxProfilerResume` to explicitly control when ATT data collection starts and stops.
  - Enables more precise, region-focused ATT tracing with reduced overhead and noise.
  - Supports multiple resume/pause cycles, each producing separate trace output files.
  - Incompatible with `--att-consecutive-kernels`.

- PC Sampling Support for Dynamic Attach: Added PC Sampling support for Dynamic Attach feature, allowing users to attach to a running application and collect PC samples without restarting the workload.
  - Enables profiling long-running or production-style jobs at the point of interest.
  - Results integrate with the existing PC sampling analysis flow.

- HIP graph attribution fields and trace:
  - Kernel and memory-copy records gain `graph_exec_id` and `graph_node_id` fields in JSON and rocpd output. rocpd conversion exposes these fields in CSV, OTF2, and Perfetto output.
  - New `--hip-graph-trace` CLI flag emits per-launch summary records (one row per successful `hipGraphLaunch`) in JSON and rocpd output, including `graph_exec_id` and `kernel_dispatch_count`. Automatically enabled by `--hip-trace` / `--hip-runtime-trace` since HIP graphs are part of the HIP runtime.
- rocSHMEM API tracing support:
  - `--rocshmem-trace` flag to enable tracing of rocSHMEM host-stream APIs.
  - Included in the `--sys-trace` and `--runtime-trace` aggregate tracing options.
  - Emitted directly to the JSON and rocpd (default, `.db`) output formats; CSV, Perfetto (`.pftrace`), and OTF2 output are produced from the rocpd database via `rocpd convert`.

**Documentation:**

- Added marker-controlled thread tracing section to the thread trace how-to guide.
- Added cross-reference from ROCTx documentation to ATT with `selected-regions`.
- Added HIP graph attribution section to the rocprofv3 how-to guide covering the new output columns, the `--hip-graph-trace` flag, the determinism contract, and v1 limitations.

### Changed

**Implementation:**

- Late-start architecture redesign: Removed direct runtime symbol access in favor of proper rocprofiler-register integration.
  - Replaced ~600 lines of `dlopen`/`dlsym` bypass logic with ~80 lines by using `rocprofiler_register_invoke_all_registrations()`.
  - Late-start now works by requesting `rocprofiler-register` to repropagate stored API tables.
  - Extensible design. Automatically supports new runtimes without SDK code changes.
  - Provides a proper separation of concerns. `rocprofiler-register` manages the table storage while SDK manages the table wrapping.
- Counter dimension encoding changed from fixed-width to variable-width allocation per dimension type.
- Dimension selection and reduction logic now uses explicit dimension masks and single-index selection.
- HSA queue interception extended to handle AMD extended kernel dispatch packets.

### Removed

- Counter collection support for plain text (`.txt`) input files has been deprecated due to lack of schema validation and input sanitization. Only structured file formats (JSON and YAML) with schema validation are supported.

### Resolved issues

- Fixed rocpd OTF2 output to add `ACCELERATOR_DEVICE` as system tree node domain for AMD devices.
- Fixed `rocprofv3` input file parsing where comment lines containing `pmc:` were incorrectly processed as valid counter collection directives, causing unintended profiling passes.

**Internal APIs (non-public):**

- Removed internal functions (were never in public headers):
  - `rocprofiler_start_late_internal()`
  - `rocprofiler_is_late_start_internal()`
  - `rocprofiler_stop_late_internal()`
- Replaced with single internal function: `rocprofiler::late_start::invoke_register_propagation()`

**Note:** Public API (`rocprofiler_force_configure()`) remains unchanged - no breaking changes for users
