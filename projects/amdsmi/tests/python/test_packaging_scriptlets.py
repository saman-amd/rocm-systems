"""Guard maintainer-script ownership boundaries between component packages.

amd-smi-lib-tests depends on amd-smi-lib, so removing or upgrading the tests
package must never disturb the main package's state. These tests assert that
invariant against the packaging templates themselves, deliberately without
prescribing HOW it is achieved: the tests component may be given its own
scriptlets, or simply be left without the main package's, and either satisfies
the contract.

Static assertions on the templates, so they need no root, package manager or
container. run_amdsmi_component_removal_test.py proves the same invariant at
runtime against real packages.
