run_amdsmi_upgrade_downgrade_test.py
====================================

The packaging rework changed how the amdsmi Python module is delivered (direct
site-packages install instead of a postinst pip install). This test exercises
the deb/rpm upgrade and downgrade paths to prove the module, the ld.so.conf.d
entry, and the CLI stay consistent when moving between two package builds.

Given an OLD and a NEW package it:
  1. installs OLD, verifies import + CLI,
  2. installs NEW on top (upgrade), verifies again,
  3. reinstalls OLD (downgrade), verifies again,
so a broken pre/postinst transition fails here instead of on a user's machine.

Requires root (installs/removes system packages). Skips cleanly if the package
manager is unavailable. Not run by default in the build harness; wire it into
CI where a prior-version artifact is available.
