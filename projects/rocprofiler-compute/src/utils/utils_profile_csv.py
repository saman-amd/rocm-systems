"""
Pure stdlib CSV read/write helpers for profile mode.

Profile mode does not import pandas, so counter CSVs are handled here with the
standard library only. Rows are ``list[dict]`` or an iterator of dicts, the
natural representation csv.DictReader/DictWriter use. Counter data is streamed
rather than loaded, since a single pass can hold millions of rows.

Files are opened through ``csv_compression``, so a caller reads a compressed
file the same way it reads a plain one and writes a compressed one by asking
for a compressed name.

This module is ONLY used in profile mode. Analyze mode can use pandas freely.
